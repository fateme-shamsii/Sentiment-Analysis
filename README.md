# Sentiment Analysis with BERT (SST-2)

This project focuses on sentiment analysis using transformer-based models, such as BERT. The task is to classify English movie review sentences as either **positive (1)** or **negative (0)** using the [Stanford Sentiment Treebank v2 (SST-2)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordnlp/sst2) dataset.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The main goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with the pipeline of sentiment analysis using transformer models:

- Load and explore the SST-2 dataset
- Preprocess the data and tokenize sentences
- Fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model for binary classification
- Evaluate the model using standard metrics
- Analyze results and suggest improvements
